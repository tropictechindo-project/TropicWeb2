# 🏆 TropicTech Complete System Report - March 2026

## 📌 Executive Summary
The TropicTech ecosystem has undergone a massive architectural transition to a self-sustaining, professional-grade rental management platform. We have moved from legacy manual processes to a fully automated, role-optimized dispatch and authentication system.

---

## 🔐 1. Authentication & Security Overhaul
We have hardened the entry point of the application to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas.
- **User Database Reset**: Purged all generic/test data to start with a clean, production-ready slate.
- **Official Admin Seeding**: 
    - `damnbayu@gmail.com` (Admin)
    - `tropictechindo@gmail.com` (Admin)
    - `ceo@tropictech.online` (Admin)
    - Default Password: `Car4sale123!` (Highly recommended to change upon first login).
- **Intelligent Redirects**:
    - **Admins & Workers**: Automatically routed to the **Landing Page (Home)** after login to browse the site with full administrative status.
    - **Regular Users**: Routed directly to their **Personal Dashboard** for order history.
- **Local Credential Recovery**: Built a custom local "Forgot Password" system. Reset tokens are now stored in our Prisma database and sent via our professional email server, ensuring 100% deliverability.

## 🚚 2. Global Worker Dispatch System (The Marketplace)
The core logistics of TropicTech is now automated via a "Push-Pull" marketplace model.
- **Auto-Dispatch**: Every new Order or manually created Invoice instantly generates a `Delivery` record in `QUEUED` status.
- **Worker Marketplace**: Workers view the global "Delivery Pool" in their dashboard. They "Claim" a job, select a vehicle, and lock it to their session.
- **Automated Lifecycle**: Completing a "Drop-off" task now automatically triggers a "Pickup" task for the same invoice, ensuring the rental loop is closed without admin intervention.
- **Inventory Automation**: Equipment status now transitions automatically between `RESERVED`, `RENTED`, and `AVAILABLE` based on worker completion events, with full audit logs.

## 📍 3. Geolocation & Real-Time Alerts
We have integrated precise device-level interactions to optimize field operations.
- **Precision Capture**: User GPS coordinates are now captured during the Checkout stage (with permission), allowing workers to navigate directly to the customer's doorstep.
- **Worker Navigation**: Added "Navigate to Customer" one-click links in the worker portal, opening Google Maps with the exact arrival PIN.
- **Device Notifications**: Implemented browser-level notifications to alert users and workers of status changes instantly.

## 📧 3. Professional Communication Infrastructure
We have transitioned away from generic Gmail delivery to a branded, high-trust email system.
- **Domain Identity**: All system emails (Invoices, Reset Links, Alerts) now come from **`contact@tropictech.online`**.
- **Resend.com Integration**: Leveraged professional API transport to ensure emails land in the primary inbox, not spam.
- **Segmented Routing**: Internal forms (Affiliate) still correctly route to `tropictechindo@gmail.com` as requested.

## 🎨 4. Visual & Document Excellence
Refined the guest-facing documents and public UI for a premium experience.
- **PDF Catalog Hardening**: Standardized casing (Email, Whatsapp, etc.) and optimized margins to solve platform-specific PDF clipping issues.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Widened package cards and product sliders to fill modern widescreen displays while maintaining tight mobile aesthetics.
- **Public Tracking**: Enhanced the tracking module to show live log events, worker assignments, and historical status changes.
