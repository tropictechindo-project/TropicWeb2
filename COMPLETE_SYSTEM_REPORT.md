# 🏆 TropicTech Complete System Report - March 2026

## 📌 Executive Summary
The TropicTech ecosystem has undergone a massive architectural transition to a self-sustaining, professional-grade rental management platform. We have moved from legacy manual processes to a fully automated, role-optimized dispatch and authentication system.

---

## 🔐 1. Authentication & Security Overhaul
We have hardened the entry point of the application to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas.
- **User Database Reset**: Purged all generic/test data to start with a clean, production-ready slate.
- **Official Admin Seeding**: 
    - `damnbayu@gmail.com` (Admin)
    - `tropictechindo@gmail.com` (Admin)
    - `ceo@tropictech.online` (Admin)
    - Default Password: `Car4sale123!` (Highly recommended to change upon first login).
- **Intelligent Redirects**:
    - **Admins & Workers**: Automatically routed to the **Landing Page (Home)** after login to browse the site with full administrative status.
    - **Regular Users**: Routed directly to their **Personal Dashboard** for order history.
- **Local Credential Recovery**: Built a custom local "Forgot Password" system. Reset tokens are now stored in our Prisma database and sent via our professional email server, ensuring 100% deliverability.

## 🚚 2. Global Worker Dispatch System (The Marketplace)
The core logistics of TropicTech is now automated via a "Push-Pull" marketplace model.
- **Auto-Dispatch**: Every new Order or manually created Invoice instantly generates a `Delivery` record in `QUEUED` status.
- **Worker Marketplace**: Workers view the global "Delivery Pool" in their dashboard. They "Claim" a job, select a vehicle, and lock it to their session.
- **Automated Watchdog**: A background monitoring service (`CHECK_DELIVERY_CLAIM`) runs every hour. If a job is unclaimed for over 60 minutes, a high-priority alert is sent to the company email for immediate action.
- **Fleet Management**: Claiming a job now correctly locks the chosen Vehicle (`IN_USE` status), preventing multiple workers from using the same vehicle.

## 📧 3. Professional Communication Infrastructure
We have transitioned away from generic Gmail delivery to a branded, high-trust email system.
- **Domain Identity**: All system emails (Invoices, Reset Links, Alerts) now come from **`contact@tropictech.online`**.
- **Resend.com Integration**: Leveraged professional API transport to ensure emails land in the primary inbox, not spam.
- **Segmented Routing**: Internal forms (Affiliate) still correctly route to `tropictechindo@gmail.com` as requested.

## 🎨 4. Visual & Document Excellence
Refined the guest-facing documents and public UI for a premium experience.
- **PDF Catalog Hardening**: Standardized casing (Email, Whatsapp, etc.) and optimized margins to solve platform-specific PDF clipping issues.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Widened package cards and product sliders to fill modern widescreen displays while maintaining tight mobile aesthetics.
- **Public Tracking**: Enhanced the tracking module to show live log events, worker assignments, and historical status changes.
