  - Creates/updates invoice
  - Sends emails to all recipients

### Workers Panel (Admin Dashboard)
- ✅ Complete UI at `/admin/workers`
  - Worker list with stats (jobs, attendance, completion rate)
  - Create new worker dialog
  - Assign job dialog
  - Send message dialog
  - Performance metrics visualization
- ✅ API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/admin/workers` - List all workers with stats
  - `POST /api/admin/workers` - Create new worker
  - `GET/PATCH/POST /api/admin/workers/[id]` - Get/Update/Assign job
  - `POST /api/admin/workers/[id]/message` - Send message to worker

### Worker Job Scheduling
- ✅ Admin assigns jobs with scheduled dates
  - Creates `worker_schedule` record
  - Sends notification to worker
  - Updates order `delivery_status` to SCHEDULED
- ✅ Worker updates job status (PENDING → ONGOING → FINISHED/DELAYED/CANCELLED)
- ✅ Status updates reflected in order `delivery_status`

### Worker Attendance System
- ✅ Check-in/Check-out with timestamps
- ✅ Auto-detection of LATE status (after 9 AM)
- ✅ Attendance history (last 90 days)
- ✅ API: `GET/POST /api/worker/attendance`

### Worker Notifications

- ✅ System notifications (job assigned, inventory conflicts)
- ✅ Unread notification tracking
- ✅ API: `GET/PATCH /api/worker/notifications`

### Inventory Synchronization
- ✅ Workers can update product stock

- ✅ Inventory sync logs with conflict flagging
- ✅ Admin override/resolution capability
- ✅ Auto-notifications on conflicts
- ✅ API: `GET/POST /api/inventory/conflicts`

- ✅ 15-second intervals
- ✅ Worker schedules polling
- ✅ Notifications polling
- ✅ Inventory conflicts polling

### Activity Logging
- ✅ All admin actions logged (payment confirmations, worker assignments, inventory updates)
- ✅ All worker actions logged (check-in/out, job status updates, inventory changes)
- ✅ Centralized logging in `src/lib/logger.ts`

### Public Invoice Access
- ✅ Public shareable invoice links
- ✅ API: `GET /api/invoices/public/[token]`
- ✅ No authentication required
- ✅ Same design as PDF invoice

### Authentication & Authorization (Overhaul)
- ✅ **Database Reset**: Purged all users and seeded official Admin accounts.
- ✅ **Admin Seeding**: `damnbayu@gmail.com`, `tropictechindo@gmail.com`, `ceo@tropictech.online` seeded with default credentials.
- ✅ **Role-Based Redirects**:
  - Admins & Workers -> Landing Page (Home)
  - Users -> User Dashboard
- ✅ **Local Auth Flow**: Implemented custom local "Forgot Password" logic with database tokens, replacing failing Supabase emails.
- ✅ **Credential Sync**: Automated sync between local Prisma and Supabase Auth for seamless SSO/Manual transitions.

- ✅ **Global Worker Dispatch System**:
    - ✅ **Automated Job Creation**: Orders and Invoices now automatically generate `QUEUED` delivery jobs.
    - ✅ **Marketplace Logic**: Workers can see and "Claim" available jobs from the "Pool" in their dashboard.
    - ✅ **1-Hour Claim Monitor**: Background job automatically monitors queued jobs; alerts Admin if unassigned for 60 minutes.
    - ✅ **Vehicle Fleet Lock**: Claiming a job locks a vehicle from the fleet to prevent overlaps.
    - ✅ **Automated Pickup Creation**: Completing a DROPOFF delivery now automatically queues a PICKUP delivery for the same order, ensuring total lifecycle automation.

- ✅ **Geolocation & Device Messaging**:
    - ✅ **Location Capture**: Implemented `LocationPrompt` for precise GPS coordinate capture during high-intent moments (Checkout).
    - ✅ **Worker Navigation**: Integrated direct "Navigate to Customer" Google Maps links in the worker dashboard.
    - ✅ **Notification Activation**: Implemented browser-level `NotificationPrompt` for real-time delivery alerts (5-minute delay).
